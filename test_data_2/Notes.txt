The files in1 and in2 contain sample Jam programs that produce the
same well-defined answers using call-by-value, call-by-need, and
call-by-name.  The files name.in1 and name.in2 contain call-by-name
(and call-by-need) equivalents of in1 and in2.  If these files are
evaluated using call-by-value, they will diverge (blowing the
call-stack in most Jam interpreters).

The files out1 and out2 contain the output text that is generated by
evaluating the programs in1 and in2---regardless of whether
call-by-value, call-by-need, and call-by-name evaluation is employed.
The programs name.in1 and name.in2 generate the same results provided
call-by-name or call-by-need (but not call-by-value) is used.

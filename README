The Parser class uses public method AST parse() to parse Jam expression. Inside the class, there are totally six private parsing methods implementedï¼Œincluding AST parseExp(Token), AST parseTerm(Token), Def parseDef(Token), AST parseFactor(Token), Variable[] parseIdList(), and AST[] parseExpList(). Each of these private methods will be responsible of parsing a specific type of expressions. In addition, each of them is referenced by a single or multiple methods, parsing the expressions recursively. The detailed process can be found here

where each section in this diagram is correspondent to a private method above. The public method AST parse() simply calls AST parseExp(Token) at the beginning, and returns an Abstract Syntax Tree if there is no syntax error. Any parsing method is able to throw a ParseException if there is a syntax error, which will finally be thrown out by AST parse(). 


Unit tests are also implemented along with the parser, and they can prove the correctness of this program. Given sample test files, including those in "simple", "medium", and "hard" folders, are also used to verify the correctness of this program.
